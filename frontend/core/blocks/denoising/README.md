# Denoising Autoencoder with DIV2K Dataset

This block contains a PyTorch implementation of a Denoising Autoencoder for removing noise from images. The Block provides functionality to load a pre-trained model, apply denoising to a noisy image, and save the results.

This block can be used in ZetaForge, an open-source platform enabling developers to design, build, and deploy AI pipelines quickly. Check out ZetaForge on GitHub: https://github.com/zetane/zetaforge.
