# Super-Resolution Image Processing with SRCNN

This block contains a PyTorch implementation of a Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) for enhancing the resolution of images. The block provides functionality to load a pre-trained model, apply super-resolution to an input image, and save the results.


This block can be used in ZetaForge, an open-source platform enabling developers to design, build, and deploy AI pipelines quickly. Check out ZetaForge on GitHub: https://github.com/zetane/zetaforge.
